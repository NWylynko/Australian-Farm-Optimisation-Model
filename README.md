# The Australian Farm Optimising Model (A-F-O)
Whole Farm Bioeconomical Optimisation Model

Currently this model is still in development. The base version (steady state linear program) is expected towards the end of this year.
Seasonal variation will then be included resulting in a discrete stochastic program (DSP).

AFO is superseded version of the whole farm model called MIDAS. The model represents the biology and economics of an Australian farm system.
We are happy to colaborate with others who may like to use this model as long as you share your improvements with us at the end. Hopefully resulting in an improved model.
The model is designed such that it is very flexible and hence it should facilitate any desired developments.
