Summary of Model Capacity
=========================

.. note:: The model is not limited to the listed capabilities on this page.

Stock
^^^^^
In the full model the livestock management decisions that are optimised can include:

#. The proportion of the ewe flock mated to different sire genotypes (pure bred, maternal type or 
   terminal)
#. The inclusion of a cross bred dam component mated to a terminal sire (the dam cross is between 
   the purebred and the maternal genotype)
#. The reproductive life of dams in the flock (based on whole flock feed requirements, reproduction 
   variation by age, the value of CFA dams at different ages, the selection pressure that can be applied on replacement ewes).
#. Whether to mate ewe lambs and the optimal proportion to mate.
#. Number of animals carried based on whole of flock, whole of year feed requirements and whole 
   farm feed supply (the feed budget is divided into 10 periods with 4 feed quality pools in each period)
#. Sale age of each animal group, up to 3 options each year (or each shearing cycle if more 
   frequent than annually).
#. Purchase options for each animal group to include a trading operation for dry animals or a longer 
   term buy in and sell operation for ewes.
#. Diet selection for the animals based on the feedbase represented in the model (likely to 
   include green or dry pasture, crop residues and supplementary grain feeding).
#. Confinement feeding of adults and feedlotting or confinement feeding of young animals (which 
   reduces the animals energy requirements due to reduced distance walked).
#. Nutrition profile of the animals during the year, based on feed variation periods which relate 
   to reproduction and the time of the seasonal break for dams and seasonal break and 
   turn-off time for the dry animals.
#. Differential feeding of dams based on litter size, lactation number and foetal age, 
   provided the dams are scanned or assessed for ‘gave birth and lost’
#. Optimal replacement policy including 
#. The change in reproduction and production over the animals lifetime, 
#. The potential to increase per head production through culling and a response in the 
   current generation.
#. Sale value of animals of different ages and different weights
#. Optimal weaning age for each dam age group

Furthermore, constraints can be applied to the model to limit 

#. Level of enteric greenhouse gas emissions and emissions of nitrous oxide from faeces and urine.
#. Bare ground during the summer/autumn period
#. Maximum levels of animal mortality or maximum level of liveweight loss during the feed limiting period of the year
#. Animals to graze at their voluntary feed intake level (i.e. that intake reflects the FOO & DMD offered to the animals i.e. feed is not rationed through active management of the stock, although pasture management can be altered to vary the FOO & quality profile)

If desired the model can also represent and compare (but not optimise in a single model solution)
#. The length of the joining period (measured in number of cycles mated). Includes the tradeoff between the number of ewes conceiving and the distribution of size and energy requirments of the later born progeny
#. Altering the age that the young ewes are mated, for example a 7 month mating versus a 8.5 month mating for ewe lambs.
#. Accelerated lambing, where ewes are mated every 8 months and therefore have 3 lambs in 2 years.
#. Variation in timing of lamb, hogget and adult shearing
#. More frequent shearing. Shearing interval of 6, 8 or 12 months can be assessed.

Feed supply
^^^^^^^^^^^
The following feed management decisions that are optimised can include:

#. Value of confinement feeding
#. Pasture variety 
#. Pasture deferment
#. level of supplementary feeding
#. Timing of stubble consumption
#. Crop grazing
#. Pasture area and rotation selection

Additional aspects that can be tested but not optimised include:

#. fertiliser application
#. impact of varying pasture conservation limits

Cropping
^^^^^^^^
The following feed management decisions that are optimised can include:

#. Rotation/crop selection
#. Contractual services
#. Labour allocation
#. Time of sowing

Additional aspects that can be tested but not optimised include:

#. Fertiliser application
#. Chemical application
#. Seeding rate
