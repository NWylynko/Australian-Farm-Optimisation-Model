<p>author: young</p>
<p>The functions in this module calculate the rate at which machinery can be used, the cost incurred
and the timeliness of certain jobs.</p>
<p>The model has been designed to accommodate a range of machine options. Inputs that are dependent
on machine size are grouped into their own input sheet, this section can be duplicated as many times
as necessary to represent different machine sizes and or amount of machinery. The model user can
then select which machine option they want in the analysis.
The user inputs the desired machinery option in property input section. If the user wants
to test the impact of different machine options they can alter the input using a saa sensitivity variable.</p>
<p>All machine option inputs (located in Universal.xlsx) are calibrated to represent cropping on a loamy sand,
with granite outcropping where whitegum is a common tree. To allow for the differences between the calibration
and the actual LMUs there are LMU adjustment factors in Property.xlsx.</p>
<p>To reduce space and complexity the model currently only represents machinery activities for seeding and
harvest (all other machinery usage is directly converted to a cost linked with another activity).
Therefore the hours of machinery use outside of seeding and harvest are not tracked. Hence
machinery use outside of seeding and harvest does not incur any variable
depreciation cost. To minimise this error, the rate of variable depreciation can be increased slightly.</p>
<p>Crops and pasture can be sown dry (i.e. seeding occurs before the opening rains that trigger the commencement
of the growing season) or wet (seeding occurs after the opening rains) <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id26">MFMC</a>]</span>. Dry seeding can
be useful in weather-years with a late start to the growing season, maximising the growing season and water
utilisation because the crop can germinate as soon as the first rains come. Dry seeding begins on
a date specified by the user and can be performed until the opening rains. Wet seeding occurs a set number
of days after the opening rains to allow time for weed germination and application of a knockdown spray.
Wet seeding can only occur during a proportion of the time because some of
the time it is either too dry or too wet to seed. The timeliness of sowing can have a large impact on
crop yields AFO accounts for this using a yield penalty (see yield penalty function for more info).</p>
<p>AFO also represents the ability to hire contract workers to complete harvest and seeding. This can be
useful for large operations, farms with poor machinery or farms with poor labour availability.</p>

<dd><p>Chemical application cost per hectare.</p>
<p>The cost of spraying per hectare is calculated based on the time to spray a hectare (see spray_time_ha)
and the cost to spray per hour. Spraying cost per hour includes tractor costs and sprayer costs.
Tractor costs consist of fuel, oil, grease and r&amp;m. Sprayer costs consist of just repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>Typically, all spraying is done at the same speed and the rate of application is simply
controlled by the chemical concentration in the spray. Thus, the cost of spraying is the same for
all chemicals and on all LMUs.</p>

<dd><p>Grazing days provided by wet seeding activity (days/ha sown in each mach period/feed period).</p>
<p>Grazing days is the number of days a hectare can be grazed in each feed period for each seeding period.
For example if seeding occurs early less grazing can occur beforehand whereas if seeding occurs in a
later machine period more grazing can occur.</p>
<p>The grazing days in each feed period per hectare sown in each seeding
period is made up of two parts. Firstly, a rectangular component which represents the each hectare
being grazed each day from the break of season up until the begining of the machine period (or destocking
date if that is before).
Secondly, a triangle component which represents the grazing during the seeding period.
The area grazed each day diminishes associated with the area sown being spread across the seeding period.
For example at the start of the period all area can be grazed but by the end of the period once
all the area has been sown no grazing can occur.</p>
<p>Rectangular component: The base of the rectangle is defined by the later of the break and the
start of the feed period through to the earlier of the end of the feed period or the start of
the machine period.</p>
<p>Triangular component: The base of the triangle starts at the latter of the start of the feed period,
the break of season and the start of the machinery period minus the defer period. It ends at the
earlier of the end of the feed period and the end of the machinery period minus the defer period.
The height at the start is the length of the machinery period reduced by 1 for each day after the
start of the machinery period. The end height is the number of days prior to the end of the
machinery period. The height is the average of the start and the finish.</p>
<p>The above returns the number of hectare days that ‘1ha of seeding in each seed period’ provides,
which can then just be multiplied by the rate of seeding and the number of days seeded in each
period to get the total number of hectare days. The last step happens in pyomo.</p>
<p>The assumption is that; seeding is done evenly throughout a given period. In reality this is wrong eg if a
period is 5 days long but the farmer only has to sow 20ha they will do it on the first day of the period not
4ha each day of the period. Therefore, the calculation overestimates the amount of grazing achieved.</p>

<p>Tonnes harvested per hour in each period for each crop is calculated from the harvest rate per
hectare (see harv_time_ha) and the average crop yield. The rate is then set to 0 if a crop can not
be harvested in a period.</p>
<p>Harvesting can begin on different dates depending on the crop. For example, in Western Australia the
harvest of canola often begins before cereals <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id35">Ros11</a>]</span>. To represent this AFO represents harvest in
multiple periods determined by the user. Each crop has an inputted harvest start date which determines
the harvest period for that crop. There is no penalty for late harvesting, however, to capture the
timeliness of completion, harvest can only occur in the dedicated harvest periods.</p>

<dd><p>Calculates the yield penalty in each mach period (wet and dry seeding) due to sowing timeliness- kg/ha/period/crop.</p>
<p>The timeliness of sowing can have a large impact on crop yields AFO accounts for this using a
yield penalty.
There are risks associated with dry sowing such as less effective weed control (i.e. crops germinate at
the same time as the weeds so you miss out on a knock down spray opportunity), poor crop emergence (if
opening rains are spasmodic patchy crop germination is possible and early crop vigour may be absent without
adequate follow up rain) and increased chance of frost <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id26">MFMC</a>]</span>. These risks are represented
in the model by including a yield penalty for dry seeding. The level of the penalty is specified by the
user for each crop and applies to all dry seeding activities.</p>
<p>Late sowing also receive a yield reduction because the crop has less time to mature (e.g. shorter
growing season) and grain filling often occurs during hotter drier conditions <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id13">HLT+19</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id38">TS92</a>]</span>.
The user can specify the length of time after the beginning of wet seeding that no penalty applies
after that a penalty is applied. The yield reduction is cumulative per day, so the longer sowing is
delayed the larger the yield reduction.</p>
<p>Yield penalty reduces grain available to sell and reduces stubble production.</p>
<p>The assumption is that; seeding is done evenly throughout a given period. In reality this is wrong eg if a
period is 5 days long but the farmer only has to sow 20ha they will do it on the first day of the period not
4ha each day of the period. Therefore, the calculation overestimates the yield penalty.</p>

<dd><p>Cost to handle stubble for 1 ha.</p>
<p>Stubble handling cost per hectare includes tractor costs and rack costs. Tractor costs consist of fuel, oil,
grease and r&amp;m. Rack costs consist of just repairs and maintenance. This cost is adjusted rotation
phase and LMU cost in Crop.py.</p>

<dd><p>Cost of machinery to feed 1t of each grain to sheep.</p>
<p>The task of feeding the supplement has a cost reflecting the fuel and machine repairs and maintenance.
This is a variable cost incurred for each tonne of supplement fed. The cost is calculated simply from
inputs which state the litres required and repairs and maintenance cost to feed 1 tonne of each supplement.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This method of calculating the cost is satisfactory but it could be improved by linking
the cost of feeding to the distance travelled which is controlled by the rate of feeding (g/hd),
sheep numbers and the stocking rate (ie lower stocking rate means sheep are spread over a larger area).
Rate of feeding could be calculated from the tonnes for feed fed (activity), the frequency of feeding
(input) and the number of sheep (activity). Then somehow adjusted for the spread of sheep over the
property using the stocking rate. Or maybe it could be calculated more like the labour required.</p>
