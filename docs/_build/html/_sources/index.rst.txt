Welcome to Australian Farm Optimisation Model's documentation
==============================================================

AFO is a whole farm bio-economical optimisation model based around an Australian farm system.

The base version (steady state linear program) is now working and the developers are working
on adding seasonal variation which will provide the user the ability to convert the model into
a discrete stochastic program (DSP).

AFO superseded the whole farm model called MIDAS. The model represents the biology and economics of an Australian farm system.
We are happy to collaborate with others who may like to use this model as long as you share your improvements with us at the end. Hopefully resulting in an improved model.
The model is designed such that it is very flexible and hence it should facilitate any desired developments.
