<p>Supplementary feeding is the supply of additional feed, primarily grain and hay, to livestock.
Supplementary feeding is commonly used to help meet liveweight targets during Summer and Autumn
months when pasture is limiting and enhance lamb diet for increase growth prior to sale. Additionally,
feeding supplement can be used as a tactic to allow pastures to be deferred. Grain and hay are the
primary supplements fed and hence represented in the model.</p>
<p>Grain and hay for supplementary feeding can either be grown on farm or purchased from another
farmer at farm gate price (net price of a product after selling costs have been subtracted)
plus the transaction and transport costs.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Other grains can be added as supplements. Just remember to add their inputs in the mach
sheet in universal.xlsx for each machine option and  the sup sheet in both universal.xlsx and property.xlsx.</p>

<p>Purchase price of grain off farm is slightly different to the selling price. The purchase price is
equal to the price the selling farmer would receive had they sold to market (ie farm gate price)

<dd><p>Machinery, storage and depreciation costs incurred to feed 1t of supplement.</p>
<p>Grain for supplementary feeding is generally stored in large on farm silos and hay in a hay shed.
There are both variable cost and depreciation costs associated with the storage of supplementary
feed. The variable cost represents the expenditure on insurance, silo preparation, insect management
and grain shrinkage/loss. The depreciation represents the yearly reduction in the value of the silos
and hay sheds.</p>
<p>In the short term storage costs are fixed, that is, the farmer incurs the same variable and depreciation
cost of storage independent of the amount of supplement fed. Additionally, the farmer is limited
to only feed as much supplement as the storage capacity. However, AFO is built to evaluate
the medium term where storage capacity can be varied. To account for this the cost
of the storage is divided by the storage capacity returning the storage cost per tonne of supplement.
This cost then applies to each tonne of supplement fed.</p>
<p>The machinery cost to feed a tonne of supplement is added in this function however it
is calculated in Mach.py (see Mach.py for details on machinery cost to feed supplement).</p>

<dd><p>The labour required to feed sheep one tonne of supplement is calculated as the time spent
traveling to and from the silo, filling the sheep feeder, emptying the feeder, and transporting
between paddocks. The transport time to and from the silo and the time to fill up are inputs which
are divided by the capacity of the feeder to return the hours per tonne. The rate of emptying
the feeder at eight different times of the year are inputs which determine the time taken to feed
a tonne of supplement at different times of the year. The time spent traveling between paddocks
(not to the silo) is calculated based on the estimated feed rate per sheep (g/hd/d), the estimated
number of sheep in each paddock and the average time taken to travel to the next paddock.</p>
<p>To improve the accuracy between different grains, the time taken to fill and empty the feeder rate is
calculated in cubic meter units (because a m3 is the same for all grain) and then converted to hr/tonne
in the last step. However m3/hr is not an input many can relate to, so in the effort of making the model
easier to calibrate the inputs are entered in a more common format for a specific grain and then converted
to m3. For example the inputs used to determine time to empty the feeder are the feeding rate of lupins
in kg/sec, this is then adjusted to m3/hr using the density of lupins.
The time spent traveling between paddocks (not to the silo) is calculated slightly differently. Driving
from one paddock to the next takes a given amount of time. This time is then allocated to each megajoule
being fed. This time is associated with the energy fed because farmers have a target for how many megajoules
to feed before going to the next paddock. Using energy also allows all grains to be compared on an equal
playing field, because the target is the same for each feed.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The main limitations to this method are if the estimated rates of feeding are wrong compared
to the model solution, it is a difficult limitation to avoid because the inputs are not aligned with
the activities ie there is no activity that is the rate of feeding sheep so we have to make an estimated
link between feeding rate and the total tonnes feed.</p>

<dd><p>M/D and DM content of each supplement are known inputs.
Unlike stubble and pasture, the energy content of supplementary
feed is expressed including moisture content. Therefore M/D must be adjusted by the DM content
of the feed. The volume of supplementary feed is calculated based on the quality of the feed.
It is assumed that the availability of supplementary feed is high and hence
does not affect intake. Furthermore, it is assumed that there is no limit on the proportion of
the sheep’s diet that can be provided by supplementary feeding.</p>
