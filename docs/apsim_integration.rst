Simulation integration
=======================

Currently in AFO the crop and pasture modules do not represent the plant life cycle at a biological level (sun, leaf area and soil properties).
Rather, the modules require inputs of a higher level.
For example:

    - The crop module requires the user to specify the yield obtained for a given crop on a given soil type with a certain level of fertiliser and chemical application.
    - The pasture module requires inputs which specify the growth curve at different FOO levels throughout the year.

.. note::
   AFO does represent livestock at a detail biological level and thus already captures the detail include in
   a simulation model.

Generating inputs for AFO's pasture and crop modules can be challenging particularly when you are examining
unknown scenarios. To aid with this process dtailed simulation models that represent plant life cycle at a biological
level can be used. APSIM is a detailed whole farm simulation model that can be used to generate inputs for AFO.
