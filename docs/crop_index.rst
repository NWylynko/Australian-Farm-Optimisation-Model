Crop
==================

In this section a brief overview of the cropping system represented in AFO will be provided, followed
by a detailed description of the cropping module in AFO. Cropping is often a large component of
broadacre farming. Crops are primarily established with a goal of harvesting and selling the grain for
human or animal consumption. However, crops can also be used as a fodder feed for farm livestock. As
described in the rotation chapter, the rotation phases specify both the current land use and the land
use history. The crop module generates the income and cost of each rotation phase on each LMU based
on the crop yield, fertiliser and chemical requirements, residual management, commodity prices, fees
and levies.
